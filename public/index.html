		<h2>Here's my story . . .</h2>
		<p>After ten-plus years in education, I decided to risk a career change to pursue my passion for coding and web development.</p>
		<p>And that's how I discovered <em>Wyncode</em>.</p>
		<p>I'm putting up this website just as we finish week three of the course. The first two weeks focused on learning and completing projects using Ruby. To see what I was able to accomplish with just two short weeks of instruction, having had absolutely <span id="disappear">zero</span> programming experience before I started this course, go check out my projects section. After Ruby we covered Internet protocols and had two days of lecture of HTML and CSS. This website is going up over a weekend to get practical experience using these technologies and to have a site to show off what we've learned. I'll be adding to it as the weeks progress adn we learn more cool shit, like JavaScript, to make things pop.</p>
		<p>By the end of the course, I'll be posting a link to the kick-ass final project I'm going to be building with a team of incredible Wyncoders. That project will show off everything I've learned in the course. To get an idea of all the stuff we will know (and why you should hire a Wyncoder!), check this out: </p>

		</ul>	
		<p>On top of the technical knowledge I'll have at the end of Wyncode, I also bring soft skills developed over my time as a professional in the education field. I have a bachelor's in English and an Educational Specialist degree in School Psychology. As a former teacher and currently licensed school psychologist, I bring years of experience working collaboratively with parents and colleagues. My communication skills will also be a plus to any organization. I've led teams and conducted presentations both locally and nationally. I might be a Junior Developer when I enter a new company, but you'll be adding a seasoned professional.</p>
		<p>So hire me already! Use any of the contact links in that box up there in the right corner that I busted my ass to get just right. Yes, that's why I'm calling attention to it. </p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>Week 1: Choose Your Own Adventure!</p>
		<p>After only a few days learning Ruby, we were assigned the task of writing a Choose Your Own Adventure game. I loved this project. It reminded me of my days in elementary school, reading The Adventures of Zork and trying to figure out how to get to the end of the story without dying in a horribly abrupt way.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, I went <em>wayyyyyy</em> overboard on my project. The requirement to give the user three choices to branch out from, but I created a monster of a program (for me at the time, at least) with three  playable areas, different characters to choose from, a host special powers, stats, dice rolls (harking back to my nerdy AD&amp;D days!!), and multiple endings. The program got so huge that to finish on time, I had to gut two of the areas, but the whole thing worked great, and just five days prior to completion, I wouldn't have been able to even imagine how such a program was possible. </p>
		<ul>For this program, I had to master:	
			<li>Ruby Syntax</li>
			<li>Ruby Methods</li>
			<li>Modules</li>
			<li>Control Flow</li>
			<li>Boolean Logic</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I learned a ton from this exercise. Particularly, I learned from my mistakes. I sat down and typed out a ton of code without testing, and I had to stay up until the wee hours debugging and testing to get it running on time. But the hard work paid off. </p>
		<p>So check out <a href="https://github.com/memnon34/Tails_of_Wyndwood">The Tails of Wyndwood!</a> It's the story of a very hungry dog hunting for treasure...treasure that smells like bacon. See if you can guide him to the best ending!</p>
		<p>To run the game, download tails_of_wyndwood.rb and wyndwood.rb to the same directory on your computer. Using Terminal, navigate to that directory, and type "ruby tails_of_wynwood.rb". That will launch the game. </p>
		<p>Week 2: Voter Simulation</p>
		<p>This project required us to build a working voter simulation using object oriented programming (OOP). We needed to give the user the ability to CRUD (creat, read, update, and delete) voters and politicians. Then the politicians had to embark on a campaign, talking to every single voter (including other politicians, who could also vote) and trying to change their minds. Voters had to give a response indicating if the politician had changed their minds, but if the voter was also a politician, the response had to be int he style of a negative campagin slogan. At the end, the voters had to vote for the candidate of their choice. </p>
		<ul>For this program, I had to master:	
			<li>Object Oriented Programming (well, master is a strong word. I have a long way to go her, but I made tremendous progress.</li>
			<li>Ruby Classes and class variables.</li>
			<li>Scope</li>
			<li>Defensive Programmig</li>
			<li>Test driven development (TDD)</li>
		</ul>		
		<p>I learned a lesson from the first project, and this time around, I employed TDD from the start. It made the first draft of the program a breeze. But then I ran into snags when I made th program repsonsive to user input. Evil users could break the program with a single unexpected input, so I spent a ton of time combing through all the various choices users could make and defending the program from crashing when evil users tried to break it. </p>
		<p>And by evil users, I mean our instructor and all the TA's that would be out to wreak havoc </p>
		<p>In the end, I got it all working. This is not as much fun as Tails, but the job got done, and done is better than perfect. Check out <a href="https://github.com/memnon34/votersim">Voter Sim</a>!</p>
